# pepper-bookmark-containing-execute
Minimum working example of Pepper application to show that bookmark containing an ^execute is not working.

On human input "bad" or "fail" the chat doesn't react to an answer of the"yes or no" question.

This approach was suggested by SBRE Partner Support, Partner request #12398:
> It is not possible to use an ^execute inside of choice delimiter.
>
> Use instead a ^goto(bookmark) to go to a proposal which contains the ^execute.
